A Tic-tac-toe game made with python. Made in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/Unn0o">@Unn0o</a>.<br>
The game works over wifi you just need to define the server codes(tttServer.py) ip address on line 141 on the 
client side(tttClient.py). You can leave the serverside code ip as 0.0.0.0.


In this picture you can see what kind of connections and components we use.
